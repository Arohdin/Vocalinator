# Vocalinator

This is a top-down space shooter created from scratch using JavaScript. The project was made as an compulsory assignment in the course 
TFYA65 (Sound of Physics) at Link√∂ping University.


## Game Rules

Shoot the enemies using your voice! The different colors of the enemies corresponds to different pitches; low, medium, high (red, green, orange). In the playing field you'll find "black" holes. These can be used to quickly move between them or to execute some sweet strats!
If you shoot into a "black" hole your projectile will emerge from another hole! The "black" holes also have a gravitational field around them making curved projectile paths a reality.
 
 
 ## Controls
 
 Use WASD to move the spaceship and aim using the mouse.
 To shoot you have to use your voice!
 The pitch of your voice decides which kind of projectile you can shoot. The values for low and high threshold can be changed in the "Calibration" menu.
